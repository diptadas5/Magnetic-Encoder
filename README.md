# Magnetic-Encoder
 
* Designed an encoder that detects the position of a magnet and converts it's motion into an analog / digital output signal.
* The position data is read on an Arduino. 
* This board uses a AS5047P encoder chip along with other relevant circuit components.
* The purpose of making this board is to reduce retail price. One of these boards sell for $24.22 from supplier.
* Creating this board from scratch and implementing panelization saved $147 on one bacth of order (20 boards).

# Manufacturing Process

* First we meet client's board specifications. This board already had the circuitry set up according to the supplier. Only specification was to panelize the board.
* Therefore we first make the schematic of the board.
